### pygame_experiments

Intervention: Unfortunately there was something about speed-control in Pygame, I didn't fully understand yet. Now I do though. "Code Skeleton" is already updated, but the rest still needs fixing. Please give me some time to do it.

This directory contains some Pygame experiments of mine. At the moment there are:

- Horizontal Starfield
- Scrolling Background
- Vintage Input
- Yet another maze
- Rainbow Colors
- Rotating Polygons
- Code Skeleton for Pygame Projects

Check the README files in the subdirectories for details.

The license is usually the GNU GPL version 3 (or higher).
But again, the license is declared specifically in each README file in the subdirectories.
