### pygame_experiments

This directory contains some Pygame experiments of mine. At the moment there are:

- Horizontal Starfield
- Vintage Input
- Yet another maze

Check the README files in the subdirectories for details.

Python version: 2.7.

The license is usually the GNU GPL version 3 (or higher).
But again, the license is declared specifically in each README file in the subdirectories.
